SCIS Summary System - Complete Map (Multi-Program)
# SCIS – Summary & Coordination Intelligence System  
**Canonical Specification – Version 3.1**  
**Release Date:** 18 November 2025  
**Purpose:** The single, unambiguous, phase-driven, contract-first orchestration system for LLM-assisted development of one or many programs in the same flat folder.

### Core Principles (non-negotiable)
1. Everything happens inside a numbered Phase (P0–P7 + P99)
2. Every inter-program interaction is declared exactly once in A0
3. No hard-coded paths, ports, schemas, or assumptions
4. All files follow A#p#s#f# naming – zero exceptions
5. Every code file must declare its exact purpose at the very top in a mandatory comment block
6. Every component and non-component inside a file must be explicitly numbered using the global unique identifier format
7. Automation and tooling can fully parse the folder state, file purposes, and internal structure from file names + mandatory headers alone

### New Mandatory Internal Numbering System (effective immediately – applies to every code file)
Inside every .py, .ts, .js, .go, etc. file:

- Components (classes, major functions, exported modules, etc.) → numbered as **C** followed by the file’s full base name  
  Example in file `A2p3s3f2.py`:  
  ```python
  # Purpose of this file: Validates incoming API payloads against registered schemas

  class CA2p3s3f2.1:      # PayloadValidator
      ...

  def CA2p3s3f2.2(payload: dict) -> bool:   # validate_payload
      ...
  ```

- Non-components (private helpers, constants, small internal functions) → numbered as **NC**  
  ```python
  def NCA2p3s3f2.1(data: str) -> str:   # _clean_string
      ...

  NCA2p3s3f2.2 = "2025-11-18"   # SCHEMA_VERSION
  ```

This eliminates all ambiguity when referencing anything inside a file from anywhere else (logs, tests, docs, LLM prompts, etc.).

### New Mandatory File Header (must be the very first lines of every code file)
```text
# File: A#p#s#f#.ext
# Purpose: <One-sentence exact description of what this file does>
# Phase created: P#
# Components: CA#p#s#f#.# (list if >0)
# NonComponents: NCA#p#s#f#.# (list if >0)
```

### Updated Phase Table (unchanged except for new clarity guarantees)
| Phase | Name                  | Primary Goal                          | Ends when                        | Main files created          |
|-------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| P0    | Concept               | Vision for the whole folder/system    | A0p0s0f0.md accepted             | A0p0s0f0.md                 |
| P1    | Architecture & Design | Programs, interfaces, data flow decided| All maps + contracts exist       | A0 + A# design files        |
| P2    | Full Specification    | Every future phase fully specced      | All Phase Complete Maps finished | A#p0s0f5…fn.md              |
| P3    | Skeleton & Bootstrap  | Repo is cloneable, entry points exist, CI runs | “Hello world” works      | File structure + entry points |
| P4    | Core Implementation   | Main business logic (split into P4.1, P4.2…) | Core features work end-to-end | s0–s3 code                  |
| P5    | Polish & Integration  | UI/UX, docs, packaging, performance   | Feature-complete                 | Remaining code + docs       |
| P6    | Testing & Hardening   | Full coverage, security, load tests   | All tests pass                   | s4 tests + reports          |
| P7    | Release               | Deployed / published                 | Live or shipped                  | A0p0s0f6.md + artifacts     |
| P99   | Debug / Hotfix        | Emergency fixes                       | Bug resolved                     | A0p0s0f5.md + optional fixes|

Sub-phases → P4.1 = p41, etc.

### File Naming Convention
- A#   → A0 = folder-level, A1/A2/A3… = individual programs
- p#   → Phase (p0, p1 … p7, p41, p99, etc.)
- s#   → Section (0–9, see table below)
- f#   → Sequence number within that phase+section
- ext  → .md | .py | .json | .ts | .go | .txt | etc.
`A#p#s#f#.<ext>`

### Section Table (s#) – 
| s# | Content                              | Typical extensions       | Filled in phases |
| s0 | Core logic & orchestration           | .py .ts .js .go          | P3–P5            |
| s1 | Init, config, entry points           | .py .json .env           | P3+              |
| s2 | Component logic                      | code files               | P4–P5            |
| s3 | Utilities & validation               | code files               | P4–P6            |
| s4 | Tests                                | .test.* .json            | P6               |
| s5 | Reports, matrices, summaries         | .md .json .txt           | All              |
| s6 | Fix specifications                   | .json                    | P99              |
| s7 | Logs                                 | .txt .json               | Runtime          |
| s8 | Documentation                        | .md                      | P5–P7            |
| s9 | Reserved / overhead                  | any                      | System           |
### Complete File Reference – updated with new mandatory annotations

#### A0 – Folder-Level (unchanged list, but every A0 file must now also have a # Purpose header)

#### Per-Program (A1, A2, A3…) 
| File pattern                          | Phase | Purpose                                                                 |
|---------------------------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A#p0s0f2.md                           | P1    | File Structure Map – every file that will ever exist + one-line purpose for each file |
| Every code file (s0–s4)               | P3+   | Must start with mandatory header (File / Purpose / Phase / Component list) |
| Every component inside code files     | P4+   | Must be named CA#p#s#f#.#                                               |
| Every non-component inside code files | P4+   | Must be named NCA#p#s#f#.#                                              |

### Updated Official Workflow 
6. P4–P7 → For current phase N:  
   - LLM reads PreBuild A#pNs0f0.md + Phase Complete Map + A0 contracts  
   - Code is written with mandatory header + C/NCA numbering  
   - Every new file gets its one-sentence purpose in A#p0s0f2.md (File Map) immediately  
   - A#pNs0f1.md (Built report) is created  
   - Development Masters updated

### Benefits of SCIS v3.1 (over v3.0)
- Zero ambiguity: you can now reference any function, class, or constant in the entire repository with a single globally unique string (e.g., `CA2p41s2f7.3`)
- File Map (A#p0s0f2.md) + mandatory headers = perfect parsability by tools and LLMs
- Dramatically easier debugging, refactoring, test writing, and code review
- Future SCIS tooling can auto-generate cross-references, diagrams, and impact analysis instantly

This document (SCIS v3.1) is now the single source of truth.  
All future projects and all ongoing projects must migrate to v3.1 internal numbering and mandatory file-purpose headers immediately.

Version 3.1 is fully backward-compatible with v3.0 folder structure; only internal code conventions and headers are added.
