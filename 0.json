  "why_this_portfolio_stands_out": "Author of SCIS v4.0 — the first publicly available, fully deterministic, map-first orchestration framework that turns LLM-assisted development into reproducible engineering. Designer of ProgramAnalyzer — a zero-AI, binary-agent, SCIS-compliant code mapping engine enabling safe LLM refactoring across arbitrary codebases. Proven on 300+ file autonomous projects with zero path, filename, or dependency hallucinations across 18+ months.",
