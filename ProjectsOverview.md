**Marker-Based Quantum Simulation Framework (Theoretical Project)**  
This framework introduces a quantum-inspired simulation system that models quantum states using marker-encoded tables with continuous amplitude values ranging from −1 to +1, replacing traditional binary 0/1 qubit states with a more nuanced −1/0/1 off/both/on scheme. It captures fine-grained intermediate amplitude transitions through discretized decimal steps, enabling symbolic and numerical tracking of superposition, interference, and entanglement. State evolution is recorded in pandas DataFrames after each gate operation, including special snapshot tables logging transient outputs in the first ten milliseconds to capture non-stationary dynamics distinct from the stabilized final state. The modular gate-based workflow, audit logging, and systematic aggregation support transparent quantum state simulation and experimental prototyping. Although not yet implemented, this project highlights advanced system design for scalable quantum state simulation with explicit temporal resolution of state dynamics.

**CivilTutor — AI-Powered FE Civil Engineering Exam Prep Tool (Functional Console Version)**  
CivilTutor is an interactive console application designed to aid Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Civil exam preparation. It features a semantic code indexing (SCIS) architecture organizing over 600 lines of Python code and database artifacts into a machine-navigable, maintainable structure. The tool offers Q&A browsing, interactive quizzes, topic search, and score tracking, leveraging a SQLite-backed coded database. Originally a non-functional legacy codebase, CivilTutor was successfully migrated into a structured, documented, and fully operational system demonstrating the power of SCIS in transforming abandoned projects into usable software. Future plans include web and GUI interfaces, LLM integration, expanded content, and personalized adaptive learning—showcasing technical breadth in AI-assisted education tools and software architecture.

**Sequential Component Identification System (SCIS) **  
SCIS is a comprehensive, deterministic naming and tracking framework designed to uniquely identify and manage every file, component, log, and artifact within a software project. It employs a global coordinate system structured as phase (p#), section (s#), and file (f#) identifiers, with components further labeled by CpIDs embedding their hierarchical context (Cp{phase}s{section}f{file}.{component}). SCIS enforces strict naming conventions and a flat, folderless file architecture to ensure total traceability, reproducibility, and ease of validation. By embedding SCIS identifiers in all generated outputs and logs, it guarantees seamless mapping between design, code, tests, and reports, facilitating automated validation and error detection. SCIS provides a scalable organizational foundation for complex software systems, enabling reproducible builds, simplified project navigation, and deterministic artifact management across development lifecycles.

**AI-Powered Program Analysis System (Phase 1-3 Demo-Ready Prototype)**  
This standalone Python application uses AI and progressive database-as-external-memory architecture to analyze codebases of any size beyond typical AI context limits. It scans folder hierarchies, classifies folder purposes, catalogs files with metadata and complexity scores, and performs detailed dependency analysis—including circular dependency and hub file detection. Built on Python 3.10 with SQLite, TinyLlama, and NetworkX, the system has demonstrated rapid, accurate analysis on large real-world projects (386 files, 71K+ lines). Features include interactive query mode for exploring analysis data, sub-second classifications, and GPU acceleration. Future phases plan to add safe code modification capabilities and web UI. This project showcases integration of AI with classical program analysis techniques, scalable database design, and practical software architecture.

**ProgramBuilder v3.0 — Hybrid LLM-SLM Software Assembly System (In Development)**  
ProgramBuilder automates software construction by combining external LLMs for high-level design with a Small Language Model (SLM) orchestrator that assembles code from RGB-coded building blocks, where each RGB carries embedded rules for syntax, style, and security. The system enforces rule inheritance automatically during assembly and validates both design summaries (Agent Matrix 1) and final code (Agent Matrix 2) before running tests. Users interact by creating structured 11-section Development Summaries referencing RGB components, reviewing errors, and confirming fixes through iterative build-test cycles. The desktop Python application with PyQt6 GUI emphasizes rule-based deterministic construction and quality assurance without creative deviation, enabling scalable, rule-driven software generation with robust validation and error reporting.

**PaintData — Color Grid Protocol (CGP) Proof of Concept**  
PaintData explores a novel visual data encoding system where RGB pixel values within lossless PNG images represent semantic database lookups, enabling efficient computer-to-computer information transfer with significant compression (10-100×) for repetitive data. Each pixel corresponds to a token or code snippet (e.g., RGB(255,0,0) → "def"), shared between sender and receiver maintaining identical databases. The SCIS v4.0 organizes the project with phases handling core infrastructure, data models, and encoder/decoder scripts within a flat file namespace. Using Python 3.10+, Pillow, and JSON databases for token mapping, PaintData aims for accurate round-trip encoding with fast processing and practical applications in cross-platform, semantic-rich data transfer scenarios like corporate communication and code compression. Current work includes database validation, multi-DB support, and checksum integration.

**Modular AI Agent Email Evaluator Framework**  
This project implements a local, modular email evaluation system using phased Python scripts orchestrated through a SCIS-defined project structure. It combines procedural horizontal agents (binary checks) with vertical semantic agents leveraging Small Language Models (SLMs) for deeper analysis. The design separates concerns with three distinct databases handling project blueprinting, runtime agent outputs, and policy interpretation, enabling clean data isolation and effective workflow orchestration. The orchestrator manages conditional branching where horizontal agent outputs trigger corresponding vertical semantic analysis subphases based on user/system inputs, demonstrating flexible, extendable modularity. Accompanying UI mockups describe an interactive frontend for email data input and real-time process visualization. This scalable agent framework is well-structured for incremental development and testing in varied email security or compliance scenarios.
