# I Build Systems That Make Complex Problems Solvable

When codebases exceed comprehension, datasets become unwieldy, or validation 
requirements multiply beyond tracking - I design the frameworks that restore order.

**What I do:** Systems architecture for AI research operations
**How I work:** LLM-orchestrated implementation of systematic frameworks
**Why it matters:** Complex problems need better organization, not just better code

## Featured Work
- 🗺️ **ProgramAnalyzer**: Making 50K+ line codebases navigable
- ✅ **Multi-Agent Validation**: Consensus-based quality for complex outputs
- 📊 **SCIS**: Systematic organization that scales to enterprise systems
