## AI Systems & Workflow Architecture Portfolio

This repository showcases AI systems design work focused on deterministic LLM pipelines, intent capture, and multi-agent orchestration, rather than traditional “single-model demos.” It is meant to be browsed by founders, CTOs, product leads, and AI teams who care about reliability, structure, and complex workflows.library​

## Who this portfolio is for
AI tool companies building IDEs, coding agents, orchestration layers, and automation platforms.
Startups and consultancies that need system-level thinking about AI workflows, not just more model prompts.library​
Technical leaders looking for an AI Workflow / Systems Architect to make their tools more reliable, complete, and deterministic.library​
If that’s you, start with the featured systems below.

## Featured systems
These are the flagship artifacts that best represent the architecture work in this portfolio. Each has diagrams, matrices, and concrete examples where possible.library​
ProgramBuilder V6 – Deterministic Multi-Phase Pipeline
A multi-phase pipeline that turns messy user intent into structured, validated, and executable programs using LLMs plus explicit matrices and validators. It focuses on avoiding omissions, enforcing structure, and making multi-step generation more deterministic.
Intent Capture & Meta-IR Workspace
A workspace model where users express intent via icons, graphs, and structured UI, which is converted into a shared intermediate representation (Meta-IR) that LLMs can reliably operate on. This reduces ambiguity and makes intent visible, editable, and reusable.github​
Agent Matrix GUI AI System
A GUI-first multi-agent architecture using an Agent Matrix (horizontal = high-level decisions, vertical = dependent detail) to coordinate specialized agents across phases: intent, context, structure/schema, planning, execution, and review.library​
SCIS & Supporting Frameworks
Supporting frameworks such as SCIS naming/structuring, early validation matrices, and block-assembly systems that make large AI projects more navigable and maintainable over time.library​
(As this repo evolves, each item above should link to its own folder with diagrams, specs, and examples.)

## What problems these systems solve
Across these projects, the designs focus on solving common failure modes in real-world AI tools:library​
Unclear or unstable user intent → Intent capture maps, icons → graph → JSON pipelines, and Meta-IR.github​
Incomplete or inconsistent LLM outputs → Multi-phase pipelines with explicit matrices, validators, and review loops.library​
Non-deterministic multi-step workflows → Structured orchestration logic, separation of phases, and binary decision matrices for agents.library​
Hard-to-maintain AI projects → SCIS naming, module-based architectures, and visual system maps that make complexity legible.library​
The emphasis is on architecture, structure, and reliability, not on a single model trick.

## How to read this repository
Start at the Featured Systems section above and open the corresponding folders or docs. Each should include:
A high-level diagram or system map.
A short written walkthrough of the phases and data flows.
An example scenario showing how the system behaves end-to-end.library​
For each project, look for:
How user intent is captured and represented.
How validation and error-checking are done.
How multiple agents or components are coordinated.library+1​
If you’re evaluating fit for a role, the most relevant mapping is:
Role types: AI Workflow Architect, AI Tooling Architect, AI Systems Designer, Prompt Architect, AI Solutions Architect.library​
Value: Designing the systems and workflows that make your AI products more reliable, deterministic, and aligned with user goals.
