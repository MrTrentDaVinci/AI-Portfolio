# ⭐ **ProgramAnalyzer + SCIS v3.4**

### *Deterministic Multi-Agent Code Mapping System for AI-Aligned Software Engineering*

**Status:** *Designed, Architecture Complete — Implementation Not Yet Started*

---

## 🚀 Overview

**ProgramAnalyzer** is a next-generation **local-only, deterministic program analysis engine** designed to power safe AI-assisted software development.
It integrates tightly with **SCIS v3.4 (Summary & Coordination Intelligence System)** — a strict, phase-driven orchestration framework for structured, hallucination-free LLM workflows.

The combined system creates a **fully parseable, machine-interpretable software environment**, enabling LLMs to perform controlled refactoring, rewriting, architecture transformations, and cross-language migrations without ever guessing structure or filenames.

This project is currently **in the design stage**, with full architectural plans completed.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

ProgramAnalyzer analyzes codebases using a network of **binary-output agents** arranged in **horizontal and vertical matrices**.
Every agent performs one deterministic task, returning **0/1** success states, which are tracked in an internal **SQLite database**.

SCIS v3.4 then overlays a strict organizational layer that enforces:

* Phase-driven development (P0–P7 + P99)
* Canonical naming rules (`A#p#s#f#.ext`)
* Component contracts via NCCF
* Global and per-program dependency maps
* Repository-wide Memory (MEM) indexing
* Fully deterministic program evolution

Together, these systems give LLMs **perfect clarity** about the structure, purpose, and allowed actions in a project.

## 🔩 Key Features (Designed)

### **1. Binary Agent Matrix Architecture**

* Horizontal matrices = major pipeline stages
* Vertical agents = micro-tasks
* Each agent outputs only **0 or 1**
* Optional matrices activate only for detected languages

### **2. Language-Specific Component Extractors**

ProgramAnalyzer includes optional analyzers for:

* Python
* JavaScript / TypeScript
* C# (Roslyn)
* C/C++ (Tree-sitter / Clang)

Only relevant analyzers run based on detected file types.

### **3. Dependency Graph + Component Mapping**

The system produces:

* AST-based component lists
* File-level and component-level dependency graphs
* Unified system architecture maps
* Multiple visualization formats (Mermaid, GraphViz, HTML)

### **4. Embedded SQLite Database**

All agent outputs are recorded for:

* Debugging and validation
* Resume/retry capability
* Historical pipeline traces
* Full transparency for LLMs and humans

### **5. Full SCIS v3.4 Integration**

ProgramAnalyzer automatically generates SCIS artifacts:

* Program maps
* File structure maps
* Component contract files (NCCF)
* Dependency maps (global + program-level)
* MEM files for system-wide reasoning

This ensures LLMs operate with **zero ambiguity**.

---

## 🧰 Intended Use Cases

* AI-guided refactoring and architecture modernization
* Safe codebase restructuring using LLMs
* Cross-language rewrites (e.g., JS → Go, Python → Rust)
* Documenting large, legacy, or poorly-structured repos
* Building deterministic pipelines for multi-agent systems
* Research into AI alignment and code reasoning tools

---

## 📌 Current Project Status

* ✔ Full system architecture completed
* ✔ SCIS compliance rules fully integrated
* ✔ Database schema designed
* ✔ Pipeline flow fully defined
* ✔ All components mapped and specified
* ❌ **Implementation not yet started**
* ❌ Source code not yet written

This project is currently in a **pre-implementation design phase**.

## 🌟 Why This Project Matters

Modern LLMs can generate code, but they fail when repository structure is unclear or ambiguous.
ProgramAnalyzer + SCIS eliminates ambiguity entirely, enabling:

* deterministic, reproducible code generation
* multi-agent LLM collaboration
* complete alignment between humans, tools, and AI
* safe, structured rewriting of existing software systems

This represents a step toward **AI-aligned software engineering**:
systems where LLMs can reason safely, accurately, and predictably.
